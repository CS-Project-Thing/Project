This is part one of a series of warm-up tasks to familiarise the team with git, github, coding, and other basic skills which are going to be in-use in this project. This may be ignored until instructions are given to the contrary.


- #Create an Enum class with support for all the operations
- #Create a function which takes a user input, and returns a tuple (float, float | None, float | None, Enum)
- Create functions for the following, returning a float:
    - ADD: add the first two numbers (add)
    - SUB: subtract the second number from the first (subtract)
    - MUL: multiply the first two numbers (multiply)
    - DIV: divide the first number by the second (divide)
    - FDIV: divide the first number by the second, then round to the nearest integer (floor divide)
    - FMA: multiply the first number by the second, then add the third (fused multiply-add)
    - EXP: raise the first number to the second number (exponentiate)
    - LOG: take the logarithm base [second number] of the first number (logarithm)
    - RND: round the first number to the given number of d.p. given by the second number (round)


##
- Create a driver function which takes the tuple from (2) and calls the correct function, then prints the result
- Refactor the tuple into an object
